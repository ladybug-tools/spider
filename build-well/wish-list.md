### Ceiling heights
I searched for for ceiling height standards on the https://www.bre.co.uk/bretrust/index.jsp site, BSI site and elsewhere but found nothing readily available to link to. But I was able to see usual numbers for ceilings here and there.

How about we start at 2.100 and go up by 300 mm increments up to 4.8 meters, with 2.4 m as the default?

### Perimeter depths
How about starting at 3 meters and going up to or 7.2 meters again at 300 mm increments with 3.6 m as the default?

## Overhangs and Fins
How about 0 to 3 meters again by 300 mm increments with zero as the default?

If anybody knows of any suitable regulatory standards or codes, then please send a link and we can build one of the demo menus around such guidelines.
