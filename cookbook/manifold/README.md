### Full Screen: [Manifold]( http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/cookbook/manifold/ )

<details open >
<summary>Concept</summary>

Given: arbitrary geometry object in 3D space composed of triangles - in other words any Three.js Mesh object)

Task 1: Poke a hole or any number of holesin the geometry by moving any vertex at any arbitrary location in the geometry to any distance away from its given position
Task 2: By algorithm only, identify the moved vertices - the errant ones making the holes - and display the positions of the errant vertices
Task 3: Repair the geometry


### Define "Manifold"

Manifold: a collection of points forming a certain kind of set, such as those of a topologically closed surface or an analog of this in three or more dimensions.

"watertight"

* closely sealed, fastened, or fitted so that no water enters or passes through.


### Triangular faces check

Three.js meshes are composed of triangular faces. This script checks the edges of every face and establish whether or not there is a duplicate edge occurring in another face. The absence of a duplicate indicates a non-manifold mesh.

### 2019-12-18 ~ Theo

Manifold v.0.04.05

* Appears to be doing a very good job at finding vertexes with issues
* Highlights errant vertices with a little box
* Highlights vase with issues by adding a red border
* Add ability to test on OBJ files
	* Select from list of OBJ Files
	* Open file using OS file dialog


### 2019-12-13 ~ Theo

Manifold v.0.04.02

* C: Update read me links
* R: Better handling 'reset all' events
* F: Add some performance statistics
* R: Capturing many - but not all - errant vertices




### 2019-12-12 ~ Theo

Manifold v.0.04.01

* Making progress

* Task 2 looks like could be accomplished with next version

Lesson learned

* Comparing index numbers is better than comparing Three.js vertices

### 2019-12-06

* First commit read me
