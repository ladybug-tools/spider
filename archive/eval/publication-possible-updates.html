As interest in comfortable outdoor spaces grows, the demand to simulate, map, and understand these microclimates has also grown. However, such mapping rarely occurs in practice, as it requires the modelling of several complex factors: wind, sun, surface temperature, and urban heat island. At present, it is clear that a workflow to map outdoor comfort cannot include all of these factors without requiring months to compute. Accordingly, this study attempts to simulate the most accurate map of outdoor thermal comfort currently possible for a 3-block urban setting in Singapore. Next, the contributing factors are systematically removed to deduce the minimum needed to create a sufficiently accurate map. Findings indicate that, on average, the comfort conditions reported on meteorological weather networks are ~2.4o C different from a given microclimate within the urban test site. The diversity of direct sun and sky heat exchange can account for a little over a third of this discrepancy. Wind patterns similarly account for a significant fraction of this difference but results suggest that a small number wind simulations are needed to appropriately account for such patterns. Surface temperatures and heat island effect each account for a smaller ~0.5o C difference. Strategies for generating faster microclimate maps are discussed and recommendations for meteorological reporting methods are proposed.

How does one tell the story of energy production, use, or conservation in a manner sufficiently convincing to influence policy, behavior, and design? Energy Accounts explores potential answers to this question through compelling images, data visualizations, narratives, and other examples of accounting for energy. Organized into a collection containing both examples of best practices and critiques, this impressive array of projects and contributors combines text and graphic material to explore different representations of energy data. Including work from Kieran Timberlake, SHoP, AMO, Lateral Office, WOHA, and many more, the book boasts a unique graphic design which supports and enhances its role as a valuable resource for professionals and students in architecture, engineering, and urban design.

Over the past few decades, several methods for designing shades to reduce energy loads of buildings have emerged. However, to date there are virtually no agreed upon methods available to assist in the design of outdoor shades to keep people comfortable. Here we present a novel method named ComfortCover to assist in the design of static shades in outdoor conditions using a 3-step methodology adapted from the current state-of-the-art process for the design of building shades. The first step is an assessment of radiation falling on a person and the calculation of a corresponding solar-adjusted radiant temperature for every hour of the year. Second, this temperature is fed into an hourly calculation of Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI). Lastly, this UTCI is fed into an algorithm that projects sun vectors for every hour of the year from the location of a person through a surface where shade design is being considered. Each of the vectors is associated with a UTCI and a temperature difference from a 'comfort temperature' that is summed up for every subdivision of the test shade to color it with shade helpfulness (blue), shade harmfulness (red) and no major effect of shade (white).

The relationship between people and the thermal environment has a profound impact on lifestyle and culture, influencing what we wear, what spaces we gather around, and how we go about our lives. Yet this relation is often oversimplified in the design of conditioned spaces, assuming occupants have unchanging thermal preferences and no desire to participate in the shaping of a building's microclimates. While we gain a basic satisfaction of thermal need from this simplified view, we lose much by complicating our buildings with HVAC equipment to the point that inhabitants do not understand them, by cellularizing space into bubbles of conditioned air that limit opportunities for continuous communal space, and by having occupants rely on central heating/cooling systems that often require harmful concentrated energy sources, such as fossil fuels. This thesis asks if and how we can design spaces of everyday life that not only satisfy a basic thermal need but also encourage occupant participation in the shaping of microclimates, promote thermally-based social cohesion, and do so using only on passive means. Since the traditional process of evaluating heating/cooling load with an energy model does not hold for unconditioned design, the thesis question requires a new method for exploring design decisions in relation to the thermal environment. Accordingly, research began by developing software to produce high spatial/temporal resolution thermal maps that evaluate design decisions by indicating the parts of a space made warmer or cooler in relation to a seasonal "comfort temperature." With this new means of understanding the thermal environment, several geometric design strategies are tested for two climates - Los Angeles and New York. The tests illustrate that the geometry of a space can have an enormous effect on its thermal habitability once the assumptions of air conditioning and oversimplified occupants are removed. The most powerful of the tested design strategies are used to develop two completely passive urban co-habitation/co-working projects that express and embellish these discovered geometric factors. The designs operate off of a generalizable logic in which the communal, daytime spaces are placed in the areas of a site where they can take advantage of the most powerful and stable thermal strategies while the fringes include less stable, intermittently- occupied, private spaces where occupants can tune the microclimate as they wish. Although this generalizable logic is constant, the two designs illustrate that widely different forms can emerge based on the climate and the tested strategies.
