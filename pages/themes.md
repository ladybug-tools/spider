# [Spider Themes Read Me]( #themes.md )


## Mission

The mission is to show that the Spider scripts you are viewing support a variety of theme possibilities

The scripts in Spider are generally built as demos. The intention is that if you like a script, you will fork it and customize it for your own needs and requirements. If you cannot do this yourself just ask us and we will do what we can to help you.

As demos, the scripts are designed with the intent that working in future is more important than coping with all issues of older browsers. If your organization has a need to support IE6 or Safari or whatever, the Spider team will happy to collaborate with you in building a solution that meets your needs.


* Easy-peasy style sheets
	* Easy for programming beginners to understand
	* Easy for experienced developers to update and enhance
* Styles that may adapted to the particular standards and need of any organization
	* Includes supplying scripts to help with changing and adapting styles
* Showcasing of styling possibilities
	* Use features of latest releases / no polyfills
* Select from a number of available styles
	* Your personal choices are retained from session to session using localStorage
* Default style sheet always available
	* So you can start hacking from the get-go

## Coding style for style sheets

Styles are organized by:

* Selector ( body, h1, div )
	* But *, root, html and body are at the top
* Classes
* IDs

Within each of the above groupings, the order is alphabetical.

Within declarations, the order of properties is alphabetical.

In order to reduce scrolling, multiple declarations are included in a single line

The above are personal choices. The over-riding intention is that is is easy for you to read the styles and customize them for your needs.


## Wish List / To Do

* 2019-03-23 ~ Theo ~ Establish a Spider 'house' style or two that is remarkably spidey-sensible
* 2019-03-23 ~ Theo ~ Incorporate styles that are disabled friendly
