_2018-03-09 ~ A few updates_

[Michal]( https://github.com/mdengusiak ) and [Theo]( https://github.com/orgs/ladybug-tools/people/theo-armour ) have been having a lot of fun building the Ladybug Tools / Spider [gbXML Viewer]( http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/gbxml-viewer/r11/gv-app/gv-app.html ) and preparing it for a soft launch. We are both pleased to be joined by our new collaborator [Michalina]( https://github.com/michalinadengusiak ). She is the  [colorist]( https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Colorist ) for the project and is preparing the color palettes for the user interface.

_2017-10-14 ~ Page started. Still in its infancy._

Thank you [Ben]( https://github.com/bwelle ) and [Anton]( https://github.com/antonszilasi ) and [Chien Si]( https://github.com/chiensiTB ) for initiating the Build Well and gbXML Viewer effort - and to [Mostapha]( https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari ) for guidance in even bigger efforts

Thank you [Michal]( https://github.com/mdengusiak ) for your highly visual insights and feedback - essential to developing a well-tested 3D world ( virtual and/or as built ;-)

Most probably Spider is not following the licensing guidelines of the various map sources.

It will take time and effort to learn, develop fixes and apply the fixes.

In the meantime we offer our humble thanks and great admiration to:
