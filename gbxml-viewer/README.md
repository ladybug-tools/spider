## Project concept / the desired pattern

#### Knowledge embedded in gbXML files is viewable, analyzable and editable in real-time interactive 3D with free, open-source web apps

### The current issues / the problems to be solved


[Green Building XML (gbXML)]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Building_XML ) as described by its authors:

> gbXML allows disparate 3D [building information models (BIM)]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling ) and architectural/engineering analysis software to share information with each other

The current set of [BIM authoring and CAD software tools]( http://www.gbxml.org/Software_Tools_that_Support_GreenBuildingXML_gbXML ) for gbXML include various proprietary, closed-source applications that you must download and install.

GbXML being open source, it would also be nice to be able to view gbXML files in 3D in your browser with no fees and with open source code.

The Ladybug Tools/Spider gbXML Viewer scripts are first steps toward making gbXML viewers readily available.

### Mission

gbXML Viewer is a collection of modular experiments for viewing, examining and validating gbXML files in 3D in your browser.

#### General objectives

* Loads almost instantly
* Non-modal interface
* Fast effective workflow: get things done faster
* Full interactive 3D

#### Coding objectives

* Files are no more than a few hundred lines
* Code is simple, plain-vanilla JavaScript
* Every JavaScript file has its own name space so you can quickly identify the location of variables and functions
* Every module has a descriptive read me file
* Every JavaScript file has an accompanying standalone HTML file for testing purposes
* All revisions are always available and runnable via GitHub pages with a click of a button

### Vision and engineering objectives

* Helping students, clients and non-AEC peeps gain access BIM data easily, quickly and freely
* Facilitating the transfer of data between design programs and analysis programs
