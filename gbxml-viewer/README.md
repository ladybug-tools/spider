# Spider 'Aragog' gbXML Viewer Read Me

[Spider 'Aragog' gbXML Viewer]( https://github.com/ladybug-tools/spider "Source code on GitHub" ) is a collection of [free, open source]( https://opensource.guide/ "Read all about it at OpenSource Guides" ) modular [JavaScript]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/About_JavaScript "Callout to Brendan" ) / [WebGL]( https://www.khronos.org/webgl/ "Tip of the hat to Ken Russell" ) / [Three.js]( https://threejs.org/ "Hi Mr.doob" ) experiments hosted on [GitHub]( https://github.com/about "Beep for where the geek peeps keep" ) for viewing, validating and editing [gbXML]( http://gbxml.org "Where's your schema today?" ) files in 3D in your browser. gbXML is an industry supported file format for sharing building information between numerous building design software tools.

## The concept / The desired pattern:

#### Knowledge embedded in gbXML files is viewable, analyzable and editable in real-time interactive 3D with free, open-source web apps

### The current issues / The problems to be solved


[Green Building XML (gbXML)]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Building_XML ) as described by its authors:

> gbXML allows disparate 3D [building information models (BIM)]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling ) and architectural/engineering analysis software to share information with each other

The current set of [BIM authoring and CAD software tools]( http://www.gbxml.org/Software_Tools_that_Support_GreenBuildingXML_gbXML ) for gbXML include various proprietary, closed-source applications that you must download and install.

GbXML being open source, it would also be nice to be able to view gbXML files in 3D in your browser with no fees and with open source code.

The Ladybug Tools/Spider gbXML Viewer scripts are first steps toward making gbXML viewers readily available.

### Mission

gbXML Viewer is a collection of modular experiments for viewing, examining and validating gbXML files in 3D in your browser.

Objectives

* Loads almost instantly
* Non-modal interface
* Fast effective workflow: get things done faster
* Full interactive 3D

### Vision

* Helping students, clients and non-AEC peeps gain access BIM data easily, quickly and freely
* Facilitating the transfer of data between design programs and analysis programs


## Things you can do using this script

* Use one/two/three fingers to rotate/zoom/pan the display in 3D
	* Or left/scroll/right with your pointing device
* Click the three bars( 'hamburger menu icon' ) to slide the menu in and out
* Click the [Stats]( https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js/ ) box in the footer to toggle FPS / MS / MB views
* Press Control-U/Command-Option-U to view the source code
* Press Control-Shift-J/Command-Option-J to see if the JavaScript console reports any errors
