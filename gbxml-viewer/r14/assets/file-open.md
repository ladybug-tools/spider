# Opening and loading files with gbXML Viewer

## The problem to be Solved / The Concept

You are testing and trying to fix a gbXML file full of issues. You need to load and view the same file over and over again.

The goal is to have gbXML viewer open files in whatever way is best and fastest for you. There are many different kinds of workflows. We want to help you be as efficient as possible. This file tries to explain rhe various ways the gbXML viewer can help you open gbXML files faster and and more automatically.


### Use your operating system file dialog box

* Click to 'Choose File' button in the main menu

### Use Drag and Drop

* Select a file off your desktop or your file navigator/explorer
* Drag and drop the file icon into the box surrounded by a dashed line in the left menu.


### Use a link

1. Copy and paste a hashmark('#') followed by an URL to the end of the link to gbXML Viewer in the address bar of your browser
	* Example: http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/gbxml-viewer/#https://rawgit.com/GreenBuildingXML/Sample-gbXML-Files/master/Urban_House_MEP.xml
2. Copy and paste a hashmark('#') followed b a relative link to the end of the link to gbXML Viewer in the address bar of your browser
	* Example: http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/gbxml-viewer/#../../../gbxml-sample-files/RevitTwoSpaces.xml
3. Copy and paste a hashmark('#') followed by a file URI to the end of the link to gbXML Viewer in the address bar of your browser
	* See Wikipedia [File URI Scheme]() https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_URI_scheme )
	* See Stackoverflow [How can I create a link to a local file on a locally-run web page?]( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18246053/how-can-i-create-a-link-to-a-local-file-on-a-locally-run-web-page/18246357 )


### Set a default file path

* Similar to using a link. All three methods should work
* Copy and paste a link - no the hashmark needed - into the default path text iuput box
* Every time you reload the page the default file will appear - even in between sessions
* To stop loading a default file just clear the default file text input box
