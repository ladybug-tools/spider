## Concept

This is a growing and ongoing effort to document what there is to be known regarding exporting and importing gbXML files

All data in this user guide is created in [Markdown]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown ) files editable on GitHub.

> The Green Building XML schema (gbXML) is an open schema developed to facilitate transfer of building data stored in Building Information Models (BIM) to engineering analysis tools. gbXML is being integrated into a range of software CAD and engineering tools and supported by leading 3D BIM vendors. gbXML is streamlined to transfer building properties to and from engineering analysis tools to reduce the interoperability issues and eliminate plan take-off time.

> March 21, 2016 ~ “I can never get it to work”: This is a common response from our customers when discussing the import of a gbXML file from Revit into TAS or any other analysis software.
>Importing a gbXML file into an analysis software provides lots of benefits including; data consistency, integrity and importantly it will save you time, however importing the gbXML file into your analysis software can be a challenge in itself. This is quite often not something the user trying to import the file is doing wrong, but can stem from the techniques used with the model originator.

> EDSL Guide for Revit gbXML Files ~ Introduction 
> This guide explains how to create a Revit model in such a way that it will
create a good gbXML file. Many geometry issues with gbXML files can be corrected
within Tas but in general the best solution is to correct the issue within the Revit file,
as this saves on extra work if the gbXML file is used again or if the Revit file is edited
and a new gbXML is exported.

> In my journey toward creating perfect energy models with BIM, I came across many online resources from the software companies. But the common theme among those resources were all the things you shouldn't do in order to facilitate a clean integration. That practice of avoiding errors ended up being a game of whack a mole, where errors would always arise and you'd have to constantly mitigate them. That's why I created a modeling structure that can be followed to mitigate 95% of your errors before they happen. Leaving you confident with your model delivery process and ensuring that you remain within your allocated time budget for the task at hand.

> * XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language.
> * XML was designed to store and transport data.
> * XML was designed to be both human- and machine-readable.

* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML>
> In computing, Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. The W3C's XML 1.0 Specification and several other related specifications—all of them free open standards—define XML

* <https://www.w3.org/XML/>
> Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a simple, very flexible text format derived from SGML (ISO 8879). Originally designed to meet the challenges of large-scale electronic publishing, XML is also playing an increasingly important role in the exchange of a wide variety of data on the Web and elsewhere.
