* First commit
* Reading SAM JSON file with no issues encountered so far 
* Current release howing only 'faces' in 'normal' color
* Apertures will appear in upcoming release
* There is an issue with the rotation of certain faces
    * Have tried two methods: lookAt and matrixCompose and both are failing
    * Work-in-progress
    * Is there a 'rule' I am missing?
    * Tomorrow I will go throuh the faces one-by-on to see if I can spot a parameter I am missing

Items for discussion

* What repo should this readme link to?
* Where should this project be hosted?
    * If this is to be in the SAM organization, then I will need a neew repo ewith full admin rights
