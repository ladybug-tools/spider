### NREL's OpenStudio Includes Spider gbXML Viewer

Spider gbXML Viewer is embedded in latest release of [OpenStudio]( https://www.openstudio.net/). See the [Ladybug Tools forum]( https://discourse.ladybug.tools/t/spider-gbxml-viewer-embedded-in-openstudio/4129 ) for details.

The code for the OpenStudio edition is maintained in a new repository: [Spider gbXML Tools]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-gbxml-tools/ ). This code is simpler, faster and better than the current releases.

So have a look at [Spider gbXML Viewer Basic]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-gbxml-tools/gbxml-viewer-basic ) and all the modules in the [Cookbook]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-gbxml-tools/#./cookbook/README.md ). These scripts will be the basis for future release of the Viewer.

## Concept

### Issue / The problem to be solved

The purpose of the Spider web presence is still a work-in-progress.

The main issue is that much of the currently available software for carrying out building visualization and analysis is expensive, hardwired and not easily accessible.

Solutions to these issues might include:

Provide free, simple, easy-to access tools to enable analysis of building outcomes earlier in the design process - or even as a stimulator of the design process

Offer easy-to-read code written so that designers and engineers may monitor, verify and enhance the efforts - and, yes, full stack developers are welcome too.

Enable just-in-time custom solutions. Every building is both unique and standards-adherent. The visualization and analysis tools should be the same.

<!-- The general idea is to adapt the practices developed in Christopher Alexander's _et al_ [A Pattern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as summarized on page 10.

> Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

>Patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.
